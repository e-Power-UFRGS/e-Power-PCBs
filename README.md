#### e-Power_conventions: Standard conventions for all PCBs
The image shows an example with conventions regarding the description data of the PCBs. One way to implemment this conventions is oppening 2 KiCad Pcbnew windows, one with the file you want to update and other with the e-Power_conventions.kicad_pcb and the copy the standard from one window to the other (yes, this is possible on the current versions of KiCad!).
